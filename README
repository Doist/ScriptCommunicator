Implementation of script communication that:
* uses script tags for communication, but can detect when a script isn't loaded (this is non-trivial to implement across browsers)
* works across domains as long as you control the domains
* works on IE 6, IE 7, IE 8, FF X, Safari, Chrome and Opera
* small (80 lines of code) with no dependencies
